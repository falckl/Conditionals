This is a simple example of how the Factory Design Pattern can be used to create new instances of clothing.
The "Clothes" interface is implemented by each clothing type class (Jeans, Sweater, Socks).
New clothing class types can be created without affecting the existing code.
The "Factory" creates objects of any given type.
Creating the clothing items in the demo shows that the user does not have to access the creation logic.
